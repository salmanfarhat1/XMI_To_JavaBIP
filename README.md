# XMI_To_JavaBIP
Phase 2:<br/>
Input: A JavaBIP XMI <br/>
Output: Executable JavaBIP Model with UI<br/>

### How it works:
Copy the content of the JavaBIP xmi file you want (generated in phase 1 from the xmi file of the variability model) into the ATL_NEW_TRANS_ssnew.xmi file or copy the xmi file you want and add the path in the code. Afterwards, you can run the tool to generate the executable javaBIP model based on the input you've entered. The JavaBIP model can be viewed in the output folder
